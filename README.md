# Bike Sharing 
## Module 14: Using Tableau to mmake Presentations
---
### Overview
The goal of this week's module was to practice transforming large data sets into visually appealing summaries.  After a fictional visit to New York, our friend Kate decides a bike sharing company would be well suited for her hometown, Des Moines, IA.  If she wants to make her dream a reality she will need to sell the idea to an angel investor.  Our task was to use data from Citi Bike, a bike sharing company founded in New York in 2013, to analyze how the company operates and create visualizations to include in our presentation.  In the process we were able to cut our teeth on a new program, **Tableau.**

### Results and Summary
From the Citi Bike Data we were able to glean insight into who uses Citi Bikes, when they use them, how long they rent them for, and where they go around the city.  This information is very helpful in estimating peak operation times and best times for repair and transport of the bikes.
