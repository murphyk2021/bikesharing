### Overview
The goal of this week's module was to practice creating visually appealing and interactive summaries of large data sets--those too large to process efficiently in Excel.  After a fictional visit to New York, our friend Kate decides a bike sharing company would be well suited for her hometown, Des Moines, IA.  If she wants to make her dream a reality she will need to sell the idea to an angel investor.  Our task was to use data from Citi Bike, a bike sharing company founded in New York in 2013, to analyze how the company operates and create visualizations to include in our presentation.  In the process we were able to cut our teeth on a new software, **Tableau.**

### Results and Summary
From the Citi Bike Data we were able to glean insight into the Citi Bikes business, such as:
- the majority of users are subscribers(repeat customers),  
- there are more male customers than female customers,  
- most rentals last less than one hour --which is likely due to the 45 minute (30 min for non-subscriber) time limit which is coupled with a $2.50 charge for each additional 15 minutes
- the most popular starting and ending stations
- the most popular rental times during the week are in the morning and in the evening --possibly for commutes to and from work
- the most popular rental times on the weekends are during the day
- the best time to do maintenance or transport bicycles would be at night

Although this data is useful in setting up operational guidelines, our angel investor is going to need some financial information!  Other visualizations which might be useful would be related to profit margins and bicycle maintenance.  Our investor may have questions about the costs of properly maintaining the bikes.  How many bikes are stolen/lost per year?  What is the projected return on these investments in Des Moines, IA?  Finally, what is the competition in the area--i.e. rental scooters, uber, lyft, public transport, etc.?
